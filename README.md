CSC 309 Lab on the Open-Closed Principle and Template Method Design Pattern

* A software artifact (e.g., module, class, package, component) should be open for extension but closed for modification

* Apply the template method design pattern to define an extensible skeleton (i.e., template) of an algorithm and allow subclasses to redefine certain steps of the algorithm (that's being open for extension) without changing its structure and without having to change other classes in the design (that's being closed for modification).
